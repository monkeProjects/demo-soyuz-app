# Souyzapp internal demo

First internal demo of soyuzapp

Because three js requiere vite for some reason now we are working with vite.
To run the app you can run

```sh
    npx vite --port 8080
```

To test app on your phone you need to expose ports in your local net.
To do so run:

```sh
     npx vite --port 8080 --host
```
