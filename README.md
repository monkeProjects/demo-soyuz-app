# Souyzapp internal demo

First internal demo of soyuzapp

To run it you can use simple python server:

```sh
    python -m http.server 8080
```

And go to <http://localhost:8080>.
You should turn on unsafe flag in google chrome that enables camera on http servers. (for safety only enable for localhost:8080)
